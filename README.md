# kotlin-mpp-shared-items-browser

Plugin for Intellij IDEA and Android Studio, providing a tree of shared (expect/actual) project elements:

* Builds the tree of shared elements in a special tool window with types indication, lists  places of common `expect` and platform `actual` elementâ€™s declarations.
* Includes hierarchic displaying of nested shared elements.
* Provides navigation to elements (opening the editor, scrolling to position in code, highlighting).
* Partially reloads the tree of elements by diffs, obtained when comparing _before_ and _after_ update trees.
* Updates by using a button and by a timer, if the plugin tool window is visible and there is an active editor.
* Allows to set the update interval. The settings are stored persistently.
